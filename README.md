## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop


### What I learned

I m learning to get a good understanding to align child div without affecting the parent div 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

I would like to continue learning other css properties as well knowing when to use which metric for a specific element argument, i.e. when to use % or rem or px.

Make a solid understadning of flexbox, i have an understading to it however i m not so much confident in myself with it.

CSS Grid is one of the other concepts onf the css that i need to get  myself familiar with. I think I have used it a couple of times in my journey as a software engineer.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#aa-flexbox-properties) - This site gave me an opportunity to dwell deep into the concepts of how to use the flexbox properties.
I really enjoyed the graphical explanations with detailed diagram and code snippets, that was cherry on-top.

- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout) - MDN is my go-to site that I most frequent when building a project, it provides a well laid-out and detailed explanations. 

Also has code snippets, what makes it stand-out is the idea of dynamic site, where you can simulate while learning to get the outcome how the code will look like as you make changes.
